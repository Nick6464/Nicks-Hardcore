# Nicks-Hardcore

I love playing Minecraft Hardcore with my friends. Hardcore means, that when one person dies, the whole world gets deleted. 
Reseting a server requires a fair bit of effort and after a death, it can be difficult to delete something you've spent so much time on.
This program automates the deleting and recreating of the Minecraft world, removing 5 minutes of down time between server reseting.

It is a python wrapper around the java Minecraft server.
When one person dies, every person gets killed. The person who died has the stat added to their user and the world resets in 1 minute. 
This gives you time to look at eberything one last time. This timer can be skipped if desired.
